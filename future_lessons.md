# Future Python Lessons: Basic Fundamentals

Here's an outline of 9 future lessons covering basic Python fundamentals, expanding upon the concepts introduced in the initial Python code.

## Lesson 1: Printing and Variables

*   Review printing to the screen using the `print()` function.
*   Explain variable assignment and naming conventions.
*   Introduce basic data types:
    *   Strings (text)
    *   Integers (whole numbers)
    *   Floats (decimal numbers)
    *   Booleans (True/False)

## Lesson 2: User Input and Type Conversion

*   Introduce the `input()` function for getting user input.
*   Explain how to convert user input to different data types using:
    *   `int()` for integers
    *   `float()` for floats
    *   `str()` for strings
*   Discuss potential errors and how to handle them.

## Lesson 3: Basic Operators

*   Cover arithmetic operators:
    *   Addition (+)
    *   Subtraction (-)
    *   Multiplication (*)
    *   Division (/)
    *   Modulo (%)
    *   Exponentiation (\*\*)
*   Introduce comparison operators:
    *   Equal to (==)
    *   Not equal to (!=)
    *   Greater than (>)
    *   Less than (<)
    *   Greater than or equal to (>=)
    *   Less than or equal to (<=)
*   Explain logical operators:
    *   `and`
    *   `or`
    *   `not`

## Lesson 4: Conditional Statements (if/else)

*   Introduce `if` statements for executing code based on a condition.
*   Explain `elif` (else if) statements for multiple conditions.
*   Cover `else` statements for the default case.
*   Demonstrate nested `if` statements.

## Lesson 5: Loops (for and while)

*   Teach how to use `for` loops to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list or string).
*   Explain the `range()` function for generating sequences of numbers.
*   Introduce `while` loops for repeating code while a condition is true.
*   Discuss `break` and `continue` statements for controlling loop execution.

## Lesson 6: Lists

*   Introduce lists as a way to store collections of items.
*   Cover list creation using square brackets `[]`.
*   Explain how to access elements using indexing.
*   Teach how to add elements to a list using `append()`, `insert()`.
*   Show how to remove elements from a list using `remove()`, `pop()`.
*   Introduce list slicing.

## Lesson 7: Functions

*   Teach how to define functions using the `def` keyword.
*   Explain function parameters and arguments.
*   Cover return values using the `return` statement.
*   Demonstrate how to call functions.
*   Introduce scope of variables (local vs. global).

## Lesson 8: Dictionaries

*   Introduce dictionaries as a way to store key-value pairs.
*   Cover dictionary creation using curly braces `{}`.
*   Explain how to access values using keys.
*   Teach how to add key-value pairs.
*   Show how to remove key-value pairs using `del`.
*   Introduce dictionary methods like `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`.

## Lesson 9: Modules and Libraries

*   Show how to import modules using the `import` statement.
*   Explain how to use functions from modules (e.g., `math.sqrt()`, `random.randint()`).
*   Introduce common modules like `math`, `random`, `datetime`.
*   Discuss the concept of libraries and packages.
