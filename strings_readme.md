This guide provides a comprehensive overview of advanced string operations and data types in Python. It is designed for learners who have a basic understanding of Python and want to expand their knowledge of these important topics.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

*   Understand advanced string operations in Python.
*   Work with different string methods for manipulating text.
*   Use f-strings for efficient string formatting.
*   Understand and use advanced data types such as named tuples, counters, and ordered dictionaries.
*   Apply these concepts to solve real-world problems.
