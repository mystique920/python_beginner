# Welcome to Python! This is your first Python program.
# Lines that start with '#' are comments - Python ignores them
# They're used to explain what the code does

# 1. Printing to the screen
print("Hello! Welcome to Python programming!")

# 2. Variables and basic data types
# In Python, you don't need to declare variable types - Python figures it out

# String (text) variable
name = "Python Learner"
print("Your name is:", name)

# Integer (whole number)
age = 25
print("Age:", age)

# Float (decimal number)
height = 1.75
print("Height in meters:", height)

# Boolean (True/False)
is_learning = True
print("Are you learning Python?", is_learning)

# 3. Basic math operations
x = 10
y = 5

print("\nLet's do some math!")
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
print("Addition (x + y):", x + y)
print("Subtraction (x - y):", x - y)
print("Multiplication (x * y):", x * y)
print("Division (x / y):", x / y)

# 4. Input from user
# Try uncommenting these lines (remove the #) to make them work:
# user_input = input("\nWhat's your favorite number? ")
# print("Your favorite number is:", user_input)

# 5. Challenge for you!
# Try creating your own variables and printing them
# Write your code below this line:
